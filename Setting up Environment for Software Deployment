Install Jenkins on an EC2:
   ● First create an Ubuntu EC2 from AWS
   ● The EC2 will need port 80, 8080, and 22 open
   ● Once you’ve created the EC2,  ssh into the EC2 from the Ubuntu terminal and log into the EC2.
   ● Then install Jenkins using the command line.
*****My observation*****
   Jenkins required me to install Java to run properly because the Jenkins application is based in Java.
Install Virtual Environment:
   ● Remote into the EC2 and install the two packages via the
apt command:
    ○ python3-pip
    ○ python3.10-venv
Connect GitHub to Jenkins Server:
  ● First Fork the Deployment repo:
https://github.com/kura-labs-org/kuralabs_deployment_1.
git
 ● Next, create an access token from GitHub:
   ○ Navigate to your GitHub settings, select developer
settings
 ○ Select personal access token and create a new
token.
****My observation****
      I had to save the personal access token key to another document because Github displayed a warning that I would not be able to see the access key again!
Create a multibranch build:
● Log back into Jenkins and select “New item”
● Select multibranch pipeline
● Add a Branch source by selecting Add source and select
GitHub
*****My observation******
      A multibranch pipeline allows for building multiple branches from a repository. It also allows multiple deployments to multiple environments if needed.
